  <pre><span style="font-size: 30px">
    For this project our team went through the process of selecting a
    startup and iteratively designing an interactive mockup for their
    web application.

  <h2>Startup Selected</h2>
  <img class="center" src="Rubberband.png" height="300" width="300">
  <pre><span style="font-size: 30px">
    The startup that our group selected is called Rubbrband.
    This company provides a web interface for scanning code 
    repositories and reporting dependency information relating to 
    machine learning. Users of this application can upload a link 
    to projects in github and have this app perform a full scan 
    of what packages will be needed within their environment to
    build their project

  <h2 class="headers">Initial Sketches</h2>

    <pre> <span style="font-size: 30px">
    The initial phases of this task comprised of each team member 
    composing sketches of what the basic layout could be throughout 
    the application.

  <h2 class="headers">LowFi Design</h2>
  <pre> <span style="font-size: 30px">
    After collectively deciding on the sketches we
    thought were best the next step was to create both low fidelity
    and high fidelity prototypes.

  <h2 class="headers">Studio Feedback</h2>
  <pre><span style="font-size: 15px">
  Summary of feedback:
  
  When receiving our studio critique, we obtained some valuable feedback which was then used to 
  improve our design. Overall, users liked the layout, but had some comments regarding buttons not 
  being uniform and the text sizes differing. Furthermore, people thought the training page should have 
  more variation when it comes to colors to better represent the states of training, and there were also 
  some reused colors that made some actions confusing. Users did like the use of red for the stop button 
  to emphasize the consequences associated with pressing it given how long training models can take. Some 
  final comments were in regards to the help page and how the format and hierarchy was not consistent, some 
  of the items were redundant with the FAQ section. The color scheme was liked by many, but there were some 
  suggestions to improve contrast with Github logos on the training dashboard, and a way to identify which page 
  in the side menu the user is currently on. Users also thought it would be nice to have a way to visualize the 
  time remaining in training instead of a percentage as training time can vary a lot depending on many factors.

  Feedback notes:
  
  - Liked the overall layout, little unintuitive that signup page goes into app
  - Back button isn't uniform 
  - Buttons and text are a little small
  - Training page, may be better to use different colors to represent state of training
  - Same color for buttons and progress bar, same color blue is a little confusing 
  - Logo's black line is hard to see on black backgrounds
  - Liked the red color for stop
  - Dashboard page, may be more intuitive to include options for … 
  - On help page, git tutorial and video, text wasn’t consistent. Was redundant with FAQ
  - Like layout of dashboard, help page was confusing because FAQ was in a column next to everything else, confusing hierarchy 
  - Really liked color scheme, github logo doesn't contrast well.
  - Marking which page the user is on, on the side bar
  - Could include expected time to completion when running
  - Weird to have dashboard be second in the menu
  - “Menu” title above menu, maybe change it to Rubbrband
  - Subscription does not specify time period
